This is a Flask project which allows setup of a self-hosted platform for recording and uploading video clips, which are indexed and stored by the user's email address and date.

## NOTES

- 2024-12-06:  I used a self-hosted Minio instance for the original backing store; it's possible to use others like S3 or a flatfile like SQLite without much trouble.  I may write up examples if I feel inclined.
